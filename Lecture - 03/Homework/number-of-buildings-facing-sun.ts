/**
 * Count the number of buildings facing the sun
 *
 * Letâ€™s understand the problem:
 * Given an input array height[] representing the heights of buildings.
 * Write a program to count the number of buildings facing the sunset.
 * It is assumed that the heights of all buildings are distinct.
 *
 * Examples:
 * Input: height[] = [7, 4, 8, 2, 9], Output: 3
 * Explanation: As 7 is the first element, it can see the sunset.
 * Similarly, 8 and 9 can see the sunset.
 * 4 and 2 can't see the sunset because 7 and 8 are hiding it.
 *
 * Input: height[] = [2, 3, 4, 5], Output: 4
 *
 * Critical ideas to think!
 * 1. How can we modify the above code to also return the building that can see the sunset?
 * 2. How can we modify the above code when some buildings have the same height?
 * Assume that a building of the same height will block the one after it.
 * 3. Is it possible to solve this problem using a stack?
